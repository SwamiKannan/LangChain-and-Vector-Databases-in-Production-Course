      "Answer: Let's think step by step. First, let us consider the basics of rain. Raindrops form from clouds that have reached a moisture level sufficient to seed out as individual droplets or larger clusters (known as hydrometeors). Cloud condensation nuclei are responsible for providing surfaces upon which precipitation can condense into these tiny water particles, and there's always going to be some available if the air is cool enough. When it rains somewhere on Earth, clouds will form due to atmospheric instability or changes in wind direction/strength (or both), which then lead to more cumulus formation within those particular updraft regions where moisture can condense out of the upper atmosphere onto individual nuclei and eventually turn into rain. As precipitation falls through these clouds, it gets caught up by their momentum; after a while its motion slows enough for some particles or parcels that are denser than air to begin falling at terminal velocities (the speed with which they would fall under the influence of gravity alone). And when individual droplets collide and merge into larger clusters due to collisions, this process is called \"coalescence.\" The resulting clumps/clusters will then either float or sink depending on\n"

      "\"The change, which saw state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay replaced with Kishan Reddy, was triggered by rising internal dissent within the party, sources say.G Kishan Reddy is believed to have a more agreeable demeanour towards the BRS.Hyderabad: The BJP's unexpected leadership change in Telangana on Tuesday marked a significant shift in the state's political landscape with less than six months to go before elections, but the makings of the announcement have been there for a while now.The change, which saw state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay replaced with Union Minister G Kishan Reddy, was triggered by rising internal dissent within the party, unusual for the typically disciplined BJP, sources say. This comes on the heels of the party's recent defeat in the Karnataka elections.Bandi Sanjay, often praised publicly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had enjoyed a meteoric rise within the party. His compelling narrative of an ordinary worker who auctioned his wife's mangalsutra to fund his election campaign resonated with many, particularly after his stunning win in the Karimnagar Lok Sabha elections in 2019.Under Bandi Sanjay's leadership, the BJP in Telangana had significantly bolstered its profile, becoming a considerable thorn in the side of the ruling Bahujan Rashtra Samithi (BRS) - more so than the Congress or the BJP had managed in the past.However, over the past few months, the BJP has been plagued by unprecedented levels of public dissension, with party leaders openly airing their grievances against Bandi Sanjay's leadership and demanding that their ambitions be recognised.The driving force behind the leadership change appears to be Eatala Rajender, a recent addition to the BJP who had been ousted from the BRS. Rajender successfully lobbied the BJP's central leadership, claiming that Bandi Sanjay's leadership style was alienating party veterans and discouraging potential recruits from other parties.While Mr Rajender's aspiration for the state leadership and potential candidacy for Chief Minister were seen as premature due to his newness to the party, his recent appointment as head of the Election Management Committee ensures that his influence continues to grow.Further fracturing the party's unity, Dubbaka MLA Raghunandan and former MP Jitender Reddy have openly questioned the party's leadership decisions and allocation of resources. Mr Raghunandan, in particular, has challenged why he shouldn't be considered for higher roles, such as state president or national spokesperson.The internal disputes reveal a significant shift in the party's dynamic, with prominent figures like Mr Rajender and Mr Raghunandan leveraging their personal political clout, gained independently of the BJP or PM Modi.Caste is also believed to have played a role in the leadership change, with Mr Sanjay, from the Munnuru Kapu (OBC) community of Karimnagar, replaced by Mr Reddy, a member of the politically dominant Reddy community.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comG Kishan Reddy, a seasoned politician with prior experience as a state BJP chief, MLA, MP, and Union Minister, is expected to bring a balance of state and national understanding to his new role. It is rumoured that Mr Sanjay might be inducted into the union cabinet, a significant switch in roles for both leaders.Political analysts also speculate that Mr Reddy's more agreeable demeanour towards the BRS, compared to Mr Sanjay's confrontational approach, could signal a potential softening of the BJP's stance towards the ruling party in Telangana.\"\n",

Suggesting that the rebels would have done better to consult him before going ahead with their plans, Mr Pawar said, \"People who went with the BJP -- look at their history.

They take everyone together, that's their Hindutva. BJPs Hindutva is about dividing people, poisonous, Manuwadi and dangerous... People who divide on the basis of religion and caste, they can't be the one who love the country.

Nagaland is the bordering state with another country. In states which share the border with China and Pakistan - we have to think a lot.

(File)New Delhi: While air pollution continues to significantly affect both rural and urban populations, India's mitigation action is hugely concentrated in the cities and often ignores rural parts of the country, a report has found. The analysis found that Particulate Matter 2.5 levels in the rural and urban regions across India are very similar. While these have witnessed a similar trend of decline over the last few years, levels continue to be higher than the safe limits in most states. While rural regions saw PM 2.5 levels decline by 19.1%, urban regions recorded an 18.7% dip between 2017 and 2022. 'Status of Urban and Rural air quality exposure at a national scale: A comparative analysis' by Climate Trends - a research-based consulting and capacity building initiative -  used Satellite-Based Application For Air Quality Monitoring and Management at National Scale data from IIT Delhi for PM 2.5 estimation and the Global Human Settlement Layer data for urban and rural classification.The report showed that Uttar Pradesh has recorded the best progress from 2017 to 2022, with a reduction of 37.8% and 38.1% in urban and rural PM 2.5 levels, respectively. Maharashtra was the worst performing state, with only a dip of 7.7% in its urban PM 2.5 levels and Gujarat - with a decrease of 8.2% in its rural PM 2.5 levels - made the least progress. The Union Territories (UTs) of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, too, made little progress, with approximately a 4-7% decrease in PM 2.5 from 2017 to 2022. And, with urban PM 2.5 levels going up by 0.3%, Chandigarh was the only UT or state to see an increase.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comDr Arun Sharma, Director, ICMR-NIRCMD (National Institute for Implementation Research on Non Communicable Diseases), Jodhpur, said, \"This analysis is a reiteration that air pollution is not a problem of cities alone; the rural population is as affected. Prevention and mitigation measures should be based on local conditions. Documentation of health effects is as important as exposure documentation.\"Sagnik Dey, Professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, said, \"This analysis is a clear indication that India is inching towards plateauing its upward rising air pollution levels since 2016-2017. This is a positive achievement, however, the challenge now lies towards bringing the needle down further, especially as we are in the last year of the National Clean Air Programme's targets of reducing 20-30% particulate matter levels by 2024.\" \"\n",

(File)New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that atrocities on tribals and Dalits are increasing under the BJP rule, as he decried an incident in Madhya Pradesh where a man, alleged to be a BJP leader, was seen urinating on a tribal.The former Congress chief said the real face of BJP's hatred towards tribals and Dalits was exposed with the \"inhuman act.\" Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the BJP over the incident and said that \"the inhuman and disgusting act done by a person close to a BJP MLA to a tribal youth in Madhya Pradesh is extremely shameful.\" During the 18 years of BJP rule in the state, 30,400 cases of atrocities on tribals have come to the fore, she claimed \"In the BJP rule, there are only empty claims and empty words about tribal interests. Why doesn't the government take real steps to stop atrocities on tribals?\" Priyanka Gandhi said.A video of a man, purported to be a local BJP leader from Madhya Pradesh, showing him urinating on a tribal person in the state's Sidhi district recently went viral on social media leading to demands for his arrest from several quarters.He was rounded up Wednesday after Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called for the immediate arrest of the man, who has since been identified as Pravesh Shukla.\"Atrocities on tribal brothers and sisters are increasing in the BJP rule. The entire humanity has been put to shame by the inhuman crime of a BJP leader in Madhya Pradesh,\" Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.\"This is the disgusting face and real character of BJP's hatred towards tribals and Dalits,\" he said.MP Home Minister Narottam Mishra said the man's act was \"heinous, condemnable and a blot on humanity.\" Asked about Congress' demand for a \"bulldozer action\" against the accused, Narottam Mishra, who is also the state government's spokesperson, told PTI, \"Bulldozer action is not taken at Congress' demand...bulldozer is used only when there is an encroachment.\" Earlier in the day, Narottam Mishra told reporters that the accused had been arrested, as he spoke of a \"bulldozer\" action without taking any names.The term became popular after the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government razed several properties owned by alleged criminals with bulldozers.On Tuesday, an official from the MP Chief Minister's Office said a case was registered against Shukla under Indian Penal Code sections 294 (obscene acts), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), and provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe stringent National Security Act has also been invoked against him, he added. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\"\n",

Unsure of what had happened, he filed a complaint at Khunta police station on Monday.Police immediately swung into action and arrested Musu's wife, the couple who bought the baby and the mediator on Tuesday.Mayurbhanj Superintendent of Police Battula Gangadhar said the woman had gone to a market with her kid but returned alone. When villagers asked her about the child, Karami told them that she had died, he said.The senior cop said police have rescued the infant and sent her to Childcare.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\"We have booked those involved in the crime including the mother under Section 370 IPC (Human Trafficking),\" added SP Gangadhar. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\"\n",

      "\"Daniel Radcliffe seems content with not returning in a cameo role in Max’s upcoming TV series adaptation of Harry Potter. In an interview, the British actor, known for playing the titular wizard in the eight-film-long franchise, confirmed that he’s not actively seeking a role in the show and that he’s quite “excited to have that torch passed.” Warner Bros. Discovery ordered a decade-long series adaptation of author J.K. Rowling’s books in April, which will feature an entirely new cast.Daniel Radcliffe is stated to be fine with not returning in Max's upcoming TV series adaptation of Harry Potter, even in a cameo role. Speaking to ComicBook.com, the British actor, known for playing ‘The Boy Who Lived' in the eight-film-long franchise, confirmed that he's not actively seeking a role in the show, adding that he's quite “excited to have that torch passed.” Warner Bros. Discovery ordered a decade-long series adaptation of the controversial author J.K. Rowling's books in April, which will feature an entirely new cast. Rowling will executive produce the series, which is rumoured to premiere sometime in 2025 or 2026.“My understanding is that they're trying to very much start fresh and I'm sure whoever is making them will want to make their own mark on it and probably not want to have to figure out how to get old Harry to cameo in this somewhere,” Radcliffe said in the interview. “So I'm definitely not seeking it out in any way. But I do wish them, obviously, all the luck in the world and I'm very excited to have that torch passed. But I don't think it needs me to physically pass it.” Radcliffe's comments on cameo appearances do hold some weight, with modern blockbusters oftentimes including past actors for nostalgia purposes or simply to drive older audiences to theatres. The Ezra Miller-led The Flash is a good example of that, with the film using multiversal shenanigans as an excuse to carry out somewhat illogical fan service, instead of telling a coherent story.The Wizarding World on the big screen was originally planned to continue with five films in the Fantastic Beasts series, but development seems to be in a state of limbo after the third one — Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore — possibly due to the latest film's lacklustre reception. As for the planned Harry Potter Max series, each of Rowling's seven novels will be adapted into a single season of television, trying to recapture the same magic as Warner Bros' movies did 25 years ago, albeit tailored for a new generation. The story largely follows the titular 11-year-old orphaned boy, who upon learning that he's a wizard is whisked away on a whimsical journey to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to harness his magical powers and learn the truth behind his biological parents' death.Since his stint in the Harry Potter films, lead Radcliffe has appeared in a bunch of theatre plays and movies in absurd roles — even playing a washed-up zombie in Oscar-winning directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Swiss Army Man. He will next be seen in the fourth season of TBS' anthology comedy series 'Miracle Workers' as wasteland warrior Sid, navigating a fictional dystopia called Boomtown. Geraldine Viswanathan (Bad Education) co-stars in it as a ruthless warlord, coming to terms with the existential terms of married life and small-town living.The Harry Potter series is allegedly eyeing a release sometime in 2025–26, exclusively on Max.\n",
