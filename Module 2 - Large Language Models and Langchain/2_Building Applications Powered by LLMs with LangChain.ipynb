      "25% of total RM costs (in both volume and value). It also f inds its  application in non -tyre rubber products like hoses, belts \n",

      " This means that if the carbon black sup ply dries up, tyre manufacturers si mply cannot make any more tyres.  \n",
      " This has become more prominent today since the world’s second largest supplier of carbon black is Russia. Manufacturers \n",
      "throughout Europe and the world rely on Russian carbon black  since they have large amount of feedstock available . A \n",

Despite lower volumes in Q2FY20, commodity prices softened and margins improved. Sentiments are improving and outlook is positive for Q4FY20 and Q1FY21.

      " The global carbon black market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4.4% from 2022 to 2025, with China accounting for 32.4% of the market share. The primary driver of the growth is the new demand from the tyre industry, based on $20 billion in new investments from 2020 to 2025. Carbon black demand is forecast to grow 4% per year from 2021 to 2025, totalling 16.7 million tons in 2025. The global carbon black industry is concentrated, with 10 players accounting for 60% of the global production capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      " The domestic carbon black industry is dependent on the tyre industry and has expanded its capacity accordingly. Carbon black is a key raw material for tyre manufacturing and accounts for 15-25% of total raw material costs. Over 70% of carbon black demand is met by the tyre industry. The industry will witness a capacity addition of 8 lakh tonnes over the next 3 years, with the majority of it being consumed by the tyre industry. Imports of carbon black have declined and exports have increased substantially in the last 3 years, indicating global players are more serious about China+1 & Europe+1. A shortage of carbon black occurred in 2018 in India due to strong demand from the tyre industry.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the production constraints faced by the tyre industry due to import restrictions from China, Russia, and other countries. It also presents an export trend analysis of Russia, China, and South Korea, which shows that China's exports to the global market have been declining since 2019. The article also highlights the declining competitiveness of China in the carbon black space due to government crackdowns on chemical companies for non-compliance on pollution norms. Finally, it provides a breakdown of the raw materials used in tyre production, which includes natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, NTCF, and other materials.\n",

      " Over 70% of carbon black demand is met by tyre industry as it acts as an effective reinforcing agent and binds key  inputs \n",
      "like NR and SR in tyre production process. Carbon Black is a key raw material for tyre  manufacturing and accounts for ~15-\n",
      "25% of total RM costs (in both volume and value). It also f inds its  application in non -tyre rubber products like hoses, belts \n",
      "and ant i-vibration products.  \n",
      " Carbon black is an elemental carbon manufactured through incomplete combustion or thermal  decomposition of heavy \n",
      "hydrocarbons. It generally comprises of two var iants - Rubb er Black (high volume, standard grade products) and Specialty \n",
      "Black (high margin, value added products).  \n",

      "Balkrishna tyres capacity of 1.4 lakh tonnes would entirely be captively consumed hence, the net addition in capacity \n",
      "would be ~6.5 la kh tonnes.  \n",
      " While a large  part of CB requirements is met through do mestic production, the domestic tyre industry  also imports CB \n",
      "from countries like China, R ussia and South Korea etc. Imports have declined and exports have increased substantially for \n",
      "the l ast 3 years indicating global players are more serious towards China+1 & Europe+1 and we feel this will remain a trend \n",
      "for the coming decade. This structural change will directly increase demand for carbon black and accordingly PCBL will be \n",

      " \n",
      "Carbon Black – The theme has just started, wait for the play  \n",
      " Carbon black is a vital component for the tyre industry . Virtually every tyre on the road uses carbon black as a filler  and \n",
      "helps to dissipate heat and protect against UV damage. An average tyre contains around 3  kg of carbon black , which is \n",
      "roughly 20 -25% weight by volume in a car tyre , hence tyre manufacturers consumes the carbon black in bulk.  \n",
      " This means that if the carbon black sup ply dries up, tyre manufacturers si mply cannot make any more tyres.  \n",
      " This has become more prominent today since the world’s second largest supplier of carbon black is Russia. Manufacturers \n",
      "throughout Europe and the world rely on Russian carbon black  since they have large amount of feedstock available . A \n",
      "survey states , around 54% of Europe’s carbon black supply comes from Russia.  \n",
      " Since the Russia invasion of Ukraine, its carbon black supply has been choked through a combination of sanctions, logistical \n",
      "probl ems, and manufacturers withdrawing from the country. In addition, natural gas prices touching unimaginable levels \n",
      "has become a serious problem throughout Europe  because natural gas is a key ingredient for the production of carbon \n",

      " A similar shortage of carbon black situation occurred in 2018 in India when demand from the tyre industry was strong but \n",
